This is the repository for LamPI, a controller for 433MHz receivers.
(c) Maarten Westenberg (aka Platenspeler)

LamPI started as an alternative web front-end for the ICS-1000 controller of klikaanklikuit(.nl).
However, it has been extended with functionality to use a RaspberryPI with commodity transmitter/receiver and use that as a controller for klikaanklikuit receivers and other brand 433MHz receivers instead.
